Original description from the theme's web page (available on [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/70271/reddit-slate-nights-2-1-dark)):

> **Easy on the Eyes**
>
> RES Friendly!
>
> **UPDATED 2017: Catching up with fixes and tweaks!**
>
> For those late nights on reddit!
> Dark slate tones and subtle hues for low contrast redditing, takes it easy on those tired eyes.
> Please note that this is a VERY low-contrast theme by design!
>
> **Problems? Suggestions?**
>
> You can PM */u/the_tenderhooks* with issues or suggestions! http://reddit.com/u/the_tenderhooks
> Please PM */u/the_tenderhooks* with your browser and OS, and when possible include a screenshot! Thanks!
>
> **Style Conflicts?**
>
> - You may need to disable some custom reddit styles if there are ugly conflicts by going to Reddit Preferences -> Display options and uncheck "allow reddits to show me custom styles".
> - Disable RES's night-theme; this style is not compatible with it.
